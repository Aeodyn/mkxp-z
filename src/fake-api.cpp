// Essentials, without edits, needs Win32API. Two problems with that:

// 1. Not all Win32API functions work here, and
// 2. It uses Windows libraries.

// So, even on Windows, we need to switch out some of those functions
// with our own in order to trick the game into doing what we want.

// On Windows, we just have to worry about functions that involve
// thread IDs and window handles mostly. On anything else, every
// function that an Essentials game uses has to be impersonated.

// If you're lucky enough to be using a crossplatform library, you
// could just load that since MiniFFI should work anywhere, but
// every single system or windows-specific function you use has
// to be intercepted.

// This would also apply if you were trying to load a macOS .dylib
// from Windows or a linux .so from macOS. It's just not gonna work,
// chief.

// There's probably not much reason to change this outside of
// improving compatibility with games in general, since if you just
// want to fix one specific game and you're smart enough to add to
// this then you're also smart enough to either use MiniFFI on a
// library made for your platform or, better yet, just write the
// functionality into MKXP and don't use MiniFFI/Win32API at all.

// A lot of functions here will probably be bound directly to Ruby
// eventually (so that you can just call Graphics.save_screenshot
// or something instead of having to make a messy Win32API call
// that *now* has to run entirely different function to even work)

// No macOS/Linux support yet.
