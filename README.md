# mkxp-z

This is a work-in-progress fork of mkxp that is intended to run as similarly to RPG Maker XP (RGSS1) as possible, specifically with the target of running games based on Pokemon Essentials, ideally without having to change a single line of code. Once this goal can be accomplished, it's possible that optional enhancements (such as Discord integration) can be written for fangame developers (you poor souls) to take advantage of.

## Prebuilt binaries
> None yet!

## Bindings
Bindings provide the glue code for an interpreted language environment to run game scripts in. mkxp-z focuses on Ruby 1.8 and as such the mruby and null bindings are not included. The original MRI bindings remain for the time being. Please see the original README for more details.

### MRI
Website: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/

Matz's Ruby Interpreter, also called CRuby, is the most widely deployed version of ruby. If you're interested in running games created with RPG Maker XP, this is the one you should go for. MRI 1.8 is what was used in RPG Maker XP, however, this binding is written against 2.0 (the latest version). For games utilizing only the default scripts provided by Enterbrain, this binding works quite well so far. Note that there are language and syntax differences between 1.8 and 2.0, so some user created scripts may not work correctly.

For a list of differences, see:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21574/what-is-the-difference-between-ruby-1-8-and-ruby-1-9

This binding supports RGSS1, RGSS2 and RGSS3.

> Note: Experimental support for Ruby 1.8's API has been added. 

## Dependencies / Building

* Boost.Unordered (headers only)
* Boost.Program_options
* libsigc++ 2.0
* PhysFS (latest hg)
* OpenAL
* SDL2*
* SDL2_image
* SDL2_ttf
* [Ancurio's SDL_sound fork](https://github.com/Ancurio/SDL_sound)
* [My Ruby 1.8 fork](https://github.com/inori-z/ruby/tree/ruby_1_8_7), for Zlib, a Windows build that doesn't segfault, and any 1.8.1 compatibility stuff
* vorbisfile
* pixman
* zlib (only ruby bindings)
* OpenGL header (alternatively GLES2 with `-Dcpp_args=-DGLES2_HEADER`)
* libiconv (on Windows, optional with INI_ENCODING)
* libguess (optional with INI_ENCODING)

(* For the F1 menu to work correctly under Linux/X11, you need latest hg + [this patch](https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2745))

mkxp-z employs the meson build system, so you'll need to install that beforehand.

meson will use pkg-config to locate the respective include/library paths. If you installed any dependencies into non-standard prefixes, make sure to set `-Dpkg_config_path` accordingly when configuring the build. If pkgconfig cannot find a dependency, meson will attempt to use CMake scripts instead (if CMake is installed), followed by system installations/macOS frameworks.

Midi support is enabled by default and requires fluidsynth to be present at runtime (not needed for building); if mkxp can't find it at runtime, midi playback is disabled. It looks for `libfluidsynth.so.1` on Linux, `libfluidsynth.dylib.1` on OSX and `fluidsynth.dll` on Windows, so make sure to have one of these in your link path. If you still need fluidsynth to be hard linked at buildtime, use `-Dshared_fluid=true`. When building fluidsynth yourself, you can disable almost all options (audio drivers etc.) as they are not used. Note that upstream fluidsynth has support for sharing soundfont data between synthesizers (mkxp uses multiple synths), so if your memory usage is very high, you might want to try compiling fluidsynth from git master.

By default, mkxp switches into the directory where its binary is contained and then starts reading the configuration and resolving relative paths. In case this is undesired (eg. when the binary is to be installed to a system global, read-only location), it can be turned off by adding `-Dworkdir_current=true` to meson's build arguments.

To auto detect the encoding of the game title in `Game.ini` and auto convert it to UTF-8, build with `-Dini_encoding=true`. Requires iconv implementation and libguess. If the encoding is wrongly detected, you can set the "titleLanguage" hint in mkxp.conf.

**MRI-Binding**: By default, meson will search for Ruby 1.8 libraries and includes within the system search path. This can be adjusted with `-Dcpp_args=-I[path]` for includes and `-Dcpp_link_args=-L[path]` for libraries. For newer Ruby versions, pkg-config will look for `ruby-X.Y.pc`, where `X` is the major version number and `Y` is the minor version number (e.g. `ruby-2.6.pc`). The version that will be searched for can be set with `-Dmri_version=X.Y` (`-Dmri_version=2.6` as an example).

### Supported image/audio formats
These depend on the SDL auxiliary libraries. For maximum RGSS compliance, build SDL2_image with png/jpg support, and SDL_sound with oggvorbis/wav/mp3 support.

To run mkxp, you should have a graphics card capable of at least **OpenGL (ES) 2.0** with an up-to-date driver installed.

## Configuration

mkxp reads configuration data from the file "mkxp.conf". The format is ini-style. Do *not* use quotes around file paths (spaces won't break). Lines starting with '#' are comments. See 'mkxp.conf.sample' for a list of accepted entries.

All option entries can alternatively be specified as command line options. Any options that are not arrays (eg. RTP paths) specified as command line options will override entries in mkxp.conf. Note that you will have to wrap values containing spaces in quotes (unlike in mkxp.conf).

The syntax is: `--<option>=<value>`

Example: `./mkxp --gameFolder="my game" --vsync=true --fixedFramerate=60`

## Midi music

mkxp doesn't come with a soundfont by default, so you will have to supply it yourself (set its path in the config). Playback has been tested and should work reasonably well with all RTP assets.

You can use this public domain soundfont: [GMGSx.sf2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qxdvoxxcexsvn43/GMGSx.sf2?dl=0)

## Fonts

In the RMXP version of RGSS, fonts are loaded directly from system specific search paths (meaning they must be installed to be available to games). Because this whole thing is a giant platform-dependent headache, Ancurio decided to implement the behavior Enterbrain thankfully added in VX Ace: loading fonts will automatically search a folder called "Fonts", which obeys the default searchpath behavior (ie. it can be located directly in the game folder, or an RTP).

If a requested font is not found, no error is generated. Instead, a built-in font is used (currently "Liberation Sans").

## What doesn't work (yet)

* Win32API calls outside of Windows (Win32API is just an alias to the MiniFFI class, which *does* work with other operating systems, but you can obviously only load libraries made for the platform you're on)*
* Some Win32API calls don't play nicely with SDL. Building with the `fix_essentials` option will attempt to fix this.
* Sockets.
* Loading data from an archive doesn't work like a real IO, so Ruby doesn't like it when Essentials tries to load files from an archive. Yet.
* Movie playback
* wma audio files
* Creating Bitmaps with sizes greater than the OpenGL texture size limit (around 8192 on modern cards)^

\* Once games can be played comfortably on Windows, I may try to have a 'fake' Win32API class written for other operating systems which intercepts and interprets some of the common calls that get used, a bit like what's already being done with the `fix_essentials` option already)

^ There is an exception to this, called *mega surface*. When a Bitmap bigger than the texture limit is created from a file, it is not stored in VRAM, but regular RAM. Its sole purpose is to be used as a tileset bitmap. Any other operation to it (besides blitting to a regular Bitmap) will result in an error. (This breaks SLLD after the professor's speech due to an issue with the tilemaps, but Pokemon Uranium seems to be okay)

## Nonstandard RGSS extensions

To alleviate possible porting of heavily Win32API reliant scripts, Ancurio added certain functionality that you won't find in the RGSS spec. Currently this amounts to the following:

* The `Input.press?` family of functions accepts three additional button constants: `::MOUSELEFT`, `::MOUSEMIDDLE` and `::MOUSERIGHT` for the respective mouse buttons.
* The `Input` module has two additional functions, `#mouse_x` and `#mouse_y` to query the mouse pointer position relative to the game screen.
* The `Graphics` module has two additional properties: `fullscreen` represents the current fullscreen mode (`true` = fullscreen, `false` = windowed), `show_cursor` hides the system cursor inside the game window when `false`.

## Building on Windows (MSYS+MinGW)

1. Install [MSYS](https://www.msys2.org) and launch it. Run `pacman -Syu`, and close the console when it asks you to, then launch MSYS using the `MSYS MinGW 32-bit` shortcut that’s been added to your Start menu. Run `pacman -Su` this time.

2. Add `C:\msys64\mingw32\bin` to your PATH. Unless you want to try and build mkxp-z statically, this is important if you want to actually run the program you built. Don't forget to log out and back in.

3. Install most of the dependencies you need with pacman:

```sh
pacman -S base-devel git mingw-w64-i686-{gcc,meson,cmake,openal,boost,SDL2,pixman,physfs,libsigc++,libvorbis,fluidsynth,libiconv,libguess} \
mingw-w64-i686-SDL2_{image,ttf}
```

4. Install the rest from source:

```sh
mkdir src; cd src
git clone https://github.com/Ancurio/SDL_Sound
git clone https://github.com/inori-z/ruby --single-branch --branch ruby_1_8_7

cd SDL_Sound && ./bootstrap
./configure --enable-{modplug,speex,flac}=no
make install -j`nproc`
cd ..

# when you install ruby, some extensions might not want to build.
# You probably don’t particularly need any, so you can just delete
# any problematic ones if you like:

rm -rf ruby/ext/{tk,win32ole,openssl}

# and try building again afterwards. Or you can try to fix whatever
# the problem is (missing libraries, usually). Hey, do whatever you need to
# do, Capp’n.

cd ruby && autoconf
./configure --enable-shared --disable-install-doc
make -j`nproc` && make install
cd ..

# `make install` runs a ruby script which apparently does not comply
# with MSYS’s unix paths, so everything Ruby installs will go to the 
# root of your drive. You have to move the resulting `mingw32` 
# folder to the msys64 root yourself.
```

5. Build mkxp-z:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/inori-z/mkxp-z
cd mkxp-z

# Ruby 1.8 doesn’t support pkg-config (Might add it in, since this
# is a bit annoying) so you have to set include and link paths yourself.
# for mingw32, includes will be at /mingw32/lib/ruby/1.8/i386-mingw32

meson build -Druby_lib=msvcrt-ruby18 -Dfix_essentials=true \
-Dcpp_args=-I/mingw32/lib/ruby/1.8/i386-mingw32

cd build
ninja
```

You'll find your stuff under your MSYS home directory. You can also type `explorer .` in the shell to take a shortcut to the results.

## Building on macOS (homebrew)

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

2. Get most of your dependencies from Homebrew:

```sh
brew install meson cmake automake autoconf sdl2 sdl2_{image,ttf} \
boost pixman physfs libsigc++ libvorbis fluidsynth pkgconfig
```

3. Build the rest from source:

```sh
mkdir ~/src; cd ~/src
git clone https://github.com/Ancurio/SDL_Sound
git clone https://github.com/inori-z/ruby --single-branch --branch ruby_1_8_7

cd SDL_Sound && ./bootstrap
./configure
make install -j`nproc`
cd ..

# when you install ruby, some extensions might not want to build.
# You probably don’t particularly need any, so you can just delete
# any problematic ones if you like:

rm -rf ruby/ext/tk

# and try building again afterwards. Or you can try to fix whatever
# the problem is (missing libraries, usually). Hey, do whatever you
# need to do, Capp’n.

cd ruby && autoconf

# We're putting our build of ruby in its own prefix. macOS already
# includes Ruby (at least until 10.16 or so), and you really do
# not want to have any conflicts with it

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/opt/mkxp-ruby --enable-shared --disable-install-doc
make -j`nproc` && make install
cd ..
```

4. Build mkxp-z:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/inori-z/mkxp-z
cd mkxp-z

# Ruby 1.8 doesn’t support pkg-config (Might add it in, since this
# is a bit annoying) so you have to set include and link paths yourself.
# the header folder that Ruby 1.8 creates for macOS includes a version 
# number (i.e. `x86_64-darwin18.7.0`), and is going to be located under
# `/usr/local/opt/mkxp-ruby/lib/ruby/1.8`.

# You will also need to link to `/usr/local/opt/mkxp-ruby/lib`, and tell
# meson where your pkgconfig path is (`/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig`).

meson build -Dpkg_config_path=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig \
-Dcpp_args=-I/usr/local/opt/mkxp-ruby/lib/ruby/1.8/x86_64-darwin18.7.0 \
-Dcpp_link_args=-L/usr/local/opt/mkxp-ruby/lib

cd build
ninja
```

Your results will be in `~/src/mkxp-z/build` . You can type `open ~/src/mkxp-z/build` to get there quickly.


## Building on Linux (Ubuntu Disco)

> I'm assuming that if you're using anything other than Ubuntu, you're probably familiar enough with this sort of thing to not need instructions. In fact, you've probably built this thing already, haven't you?

1. Open your terminal and make sure your apt cache and packages are up to date with `sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade`

2. Get most of the dependencies from apt:

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential git bison cmake meson autoconf libtool \
pkg-config xxd libsdl2* libvorbisfile3 libvorbis-dev libpixman-1* \
libboost-program-options1.65* libopenal1*  libopenal-dev zlib1g* \
fluidsynth libfluidsynth-dev libsigc++-2.0* libogg-dev
```

3. Build the rest from source:

```sh
mkdir ~/src; cd ~/src

# pkgconfig won't detect PhysFS unless you build it yourself,
# so...

git clone https://github.com/criptych/physfs
cd physfs
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make -j`nproc`
sudo make install
cd ../..

# Now we can do the other stuff:

git clone https://github.com/Ancurio/SDL_Sound
git clone https://github.com/inori-z/ruby --single-branch --branch ruby_1_8_7

cd SDL_Sound && ./bootstrap
./configure
make -j`nproc`
sudo make install
cd ..

cd ruby && autoconf
./configure --enable-shared --disable-install-doc
make -j`nproc`
sudo make install
cd ..
```

4. Build mkxp-z:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/inori-z/mkxp-z
cd mkxp-z

# Ruby 1.8 doesn’t support pkg-config (Might add it in, since this
# is a bit annoying) so you have to set include and link paths yourself.
# in this case, includes will be found at `/usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/x86_64-linux`.

meson build -Dcpp_args=-I/usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/x86_64-linux

cd build
ninja
```

See your results with `nautilus ~/src/mkxp-z/build`.
